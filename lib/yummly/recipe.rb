# This class maps a Yummly response to attributes on to a recipe object. Because the search and find API calls return
# recipe data slightly different structures, it also automatically rectifies these differences where possible.
#
# When a response attribute is an array, collections of related objects will be created for convenience. For example,
# the "images" attribute on the response maps to the #images method which returns a collection of Yummlly::Image
# objects.
